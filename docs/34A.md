34A Database Abstractions with Prisma
Your task for this workshop is to refactor the existing codebase to integrate Prisma. This will entail updating only the backend code. Before you change anything, run the server and client to see how the app currently works. The app's functionality should not be affected by your changes.

Prisma's getting started guide will be very helpful! There are also many helpful articles under the Guides and Reference sections, so be sure to check those out as well.

You can follow the guide for either starting from scratch or adding to an existing project; if you do the latter, you can ignore the portion about baselining your database.
