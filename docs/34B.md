34B Authentication & OAuth
You have two main tasks for this workshop:

Use bcrypt to encrypt user passwords. Only encrypted passwords should be stored in the database. When a user tries to log in, compare the password they provide with what's stored in the database.

Add the option for users to authenticate via Github OAuth. They should still have the ability to register and login with a username and password.

The Github documentation on building OAuth apps will be very useful to reference.
